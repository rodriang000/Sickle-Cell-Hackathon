# Package-Man

This project was created as part of a 24-hour hackathon for Northwestern Mutual's Hack-For-Good hackathon.

The goal was to create an entertaining game that can be used for for young children affected by Sickle Cell Anemia, and highlight the ways that one could mitigate the symptoms to accomplish their goals.

The premise; you're a young adult with a summer job delivering packages, be sure to take care of yourself and watch your stress meter while you travel around the neighborhood. Deliver your packages as fast as you can while maintaining your health!
